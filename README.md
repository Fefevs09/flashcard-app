# Mind Refresh (Flashcard App)

With the aim of assisting the student community in reviewing content more interactively, I'm developing an algorithm that will aid in spaced repetition, enhancing student performance.

### About Flashcard

Flashcards are a **versatile** and **effective** learning tool used for various purposes, including language learning, studying for exams, memorizing facts, and more. This documentation provides an overview of flashcards, their benefits, types, and best practices for creating and using them.

### Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning strategy that involves systematically reviewing information at increasing intervals to enhance long-term retention. By exposing learners to material just before they are likely to forget it, spaced repetition aims to strengthen memory and optimize the learning process. The intervals between reviews are adaptive, with successful recall leading to longer gaps and challenges prompting more immediate revisits. This approach is often facilitated through specialized software or flashcard systems, leveraging the spacing effect to improve memorization and overall knowledge retention.

### Benefits of Using Flashcards

- Active Recall: Flashcards promote active recall, which strengthens memory and retention.
- Spaced Repetition: They can be used in spaced repetition systems (SRS) to optimize the timing of reviews.
- Portability: Physical flashcards are portable and easy to use anywhere, anytime.
- Versatility: Useful for various subjects, from vocabulary to complex concepts.
- Engagement: Flashcards make learning interactive and engaging.

## Functionalities

- Deck organized

# Mind Refresh (Flash Card App)

With the aim of assisting the student community in reviewing content more interactively, I'm developing an algorithm that will aid in spaced repetition, enhancing student performance.

## Importance

### Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning strategy that involves systematically reviewing information at increasing intervals to enhance long-term retention. By exposing learners to material just before they are likely to forget it, spaced repetition aims to strengthen memory and optimize the learning process. The intervals between reviews are adaptive, with successful recall leading to longer gaps and challenges prompting more immediate revisits. This approach is often facilitated through specialized software or flashcard systems, leveraging the spacing effect to improve memorization and overall knowledge retention.

## Functionalities

- Deck organized
- Revision cards
- Notification
- AI create cards

### Deck organized

Organize all your cards in decks, where user can sort it as sees fit

### Revision cards

User can review your cards anywhere

The cards will appear mostly more difficult for user can finally learn that subject

### Notification

Notification user when he has review your cards

### AI create cards

With AI, users can automate card creation. Users only need to say what subject they want to create, and AI will create it for them.
